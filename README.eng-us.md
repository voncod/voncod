Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a former Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences transitioning my career to DevOps and Cloud Computing, currently studying Linux, Git, Docker, and Python.
I document my studies and small projects here on GitHub, serving as a portfolio and practical documentation.

My goal is to apply this knowledge in a professional context, contributing to automation, infrastructure, and cloud environments.
